/*
 Q10.Given the heights of N towers and a value of K, Either increase or decrease the height of every tower by K (only once) where K > 0. After modifications, 
   the task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower and output its difference.

 Examples: 

  Input: arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
   Output:  Minimum difference is 5.
  Explanation: Change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5 (between 4 and 9). We canâ€™t get a lower difference.
